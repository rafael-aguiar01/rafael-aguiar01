### About Me

<!-- I'm a software and infrastructure engineer, hobbyist data scientist, photographer, cyclist, mechanical keyboard enthusiast, and dog owner living in Cambridge, UK. I specialise in container orchestration, software development, continuous delivery, and cloud operations. With over a decade of experience, I have extensive knowledge of a range of technologies within the infrastructure and software engineering spaces, including:

* Kubernetes & containers
* AWS cloud administration
* Go, TypeScript, Python, and C# programming languages
* Infrastructure as Code, with extensive Terraform experience
* Continuous integration & delivery systems (CircleCI, ConcourseCI, TeamCity)
* Agile development methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)

I'm currently at [Weaveworks](https://weave.works) as a Tech Lead working on bare metal and edge Kubernetes solutions using [Firecracker MicroVMs](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/). Previously I worked at [Snyk](https://snyk.io) solving Kubernetes security challenges and [CondÃ© Nast](https://condenast.com) building a large scale global Kubernetes platform.

Occasionally I speak at tech events and meetups, you can see my various slide decks on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/jmickey). -->

I live in Jarinu - SP - Brazil.
